# VK's Reconnaissance through IP/Domain Scanner Tool

## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly tool designed to automate network scanning tasks using Nmap and Bash scripting. The script performs several functions:
- **Ping Scan:** Checks if the target host is up.
- **Port Scan:** Scans for open ports.
- **OS & Service Detection:** Retrieves operating system details and service versions.

The output from these scans is saved in an organized manner inside the `results/` folder for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the automated script, ensure you have the following:
- **Operating System:** Linux/Unix-based system (or Windows with a Bash environment like Git Bash or WSL).
- **Bash:** Typically pre-installed on Linux and macOS.
- **Nmap:** Install using your package manager:
  - On Ubuntu/Debian:  
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nmap
    ```
  - On macOS (using Homebrew):  
    ```bash
    brew install nmap
    ```
- **Git:** (optional) to clone the repository.

## Folder Structure

A typical project structure might look like this:
VK's Reconnaissance automating tool/\n
├── README.md\n
├── scan.sh\n
├── results/\n
└── LICENSE\n

- **README.md:** This file, containing project information and instructions.
- **scan.sh:** The Bash script that automates the scanning process.
- **results/:** Folder where scan outputs are saved.
- **LICENSE:** Project license (if applicable).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nmap-bash-scanner.git
   cd nmap-bash-scanner
   ```
   
2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   Before running the script, ensure it has execute permissions:
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x scan.sh
   ```
## How to Run the Automated .sh File
1. **Open a Terminal:**

    Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/nmap-bash-scanner
    ```
    
2. **Run the Script:**

    Execute the script by typing:

    ```bash
    ./scan.sh
    ```

3. **Review the Results:**

    After the scan is completed, open the generated file to inspect the scan details. For example:

    ```bash
    cat results/<target>_scan.txt
    ```
    
4. **Troubleshooting**
    .Permissions Error: If you receive a "Permission denied" error, re-run chmod +x scan.sh to ensure the script is executable.

    .Nmap Not Found: Make sure Nmap is properly installed and accessible. If the command is not found, verify your installation and PATH environment variable.

    .Invalid Target: Ensure you are entering a valid IP address or domain name when prompted.
